Artificial Intelligence (AI) is the simulation of human intelligence processes by machines, especially computer systems. These processes include learning, reasoning, and self-correction. AI applications include expert systems, natural language processing, speech recognition, and machine vision. Machine learning, a subset of AI, involves the use of algorithms to parse data, learn from it, and make informed decisions. AI has the potential to revolutionize various industries, from healthcare and finance to transportation and entertainment, by automating tasks, enhancing decision-making, and enabling new capabilities.
