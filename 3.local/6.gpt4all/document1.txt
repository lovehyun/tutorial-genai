Climate change refers to long-term changes in temperature, precipitation, and other atmospheric conditions on Earth. These changes can be driven by natural processes, such as volcanic eruptions and variations in solar radiation, as well as human activities like deforestation and the burning of fossil fuels. The impacts of climate change include rising sea levels, more frequent and severe weather events, and shifts in ecosystems and wildlife populations. Addressing climate change requires global cooperation and a shift towards renewable energy sources, improved energy efficiency, and sustainable land use practices.
